# TCGA-Analysis

The following code uses machine learning to identify patterns in data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) from the NIH. Specifically, I wrote a k-means 
algorithm which identified subtypes of patients with pancreatic cancer. The algorithm was written without using the standard sklearn package for 
my Machine Learning course to demonstrate my knowledge of the algorithm. ï‚§	I used a Kruskal-Wallis test to identify differentially genes
between the various subtypes in later analysis.
